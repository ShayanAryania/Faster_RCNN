# Faster R-CNN Implementation  

This repository contains a **Jupyter Notebook** implementing **Faster R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network)** for object detection tasks using **PyTorch**.  

---

## üìå Introduction  

Faster R-CNN is a **deep learning-based** object detection model that improves upon previous R-CNN architectures by introducing a **Region Proposal Network (RPN)**, making it significantly faster.  

This notebook provides a comprehensive **step-by-step implementation** of Faster R-CNN, covering:  
‚úî **Data Preprocessing**  
‚úî **Model Loading and Training**  
‚úî **Region Proposal Network (RPN) Understanding**  
‚úî **Bounding Box Prediction & Post-processing**  
‚úî **Model Evaluation & Visualization**

## üìå Model Architecture  

Faster R-CNN consists of:  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Feature Extraction Network:** Uses a convolutional backbone (ResNet) to extract features from input images.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Region Proposal Network (RPN):** Generates potential bounding box proposals.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **RoI Pooling:** Extracts fixed-size feature maps from proposals.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Classification & Regression Heads:** Assigns class labels and refines bounding box coordinates.  

For this implementation, we use **`fasterrcnn_resnet50_fpn`** from **Torchvision**, pre-trained on the **COCO dataset**.

## üìå Implementation  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Loading the Pre-trained Model**  
We leverage **`torchvision.models.detection.fasterrcnn_resnet50_fpn`**, which is a pre-trained Faster R-CNN model optimized for object detection tasks.  

```python
import torch
import torchvision
from torchvision.models.detection import fasterrcnn_resnet50_fpn

# Load the pre-trained Faster R-CNN model
model = fasterrcnn_resnet50_fpn(pretrained=True)
model.eval()  # Set model to evaluation mode
